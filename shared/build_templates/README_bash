This file is meant to give a quick overview to some of the
content located in this directory.

This directory contains BASH remediation scripts for the
associated OVAL and XCCDF content. It is worth noting that
the BASH script names must match the the OVAL 'id' and
XCCDF Rule 'id'; otherwise, the script is not merged in with
the final xml content for delivery.

This file can be removed if necessary.
